# Fast Feedforward Networks

## Abstract
We break the linear link between the layer size and its inference cost by
introducing the fast feedforward (FFF) architecture, a log-time alternative to
feedforward networks. We demonstrate that FFFs are up to 220x faster than
feedforward networks, up to 6x faster than mixture-of-experts networks, and
exhibit better training properties than mixtures of experts thanks to noiseless
conditional execution. Pushing FFFs to the limit, we show that they can use as
little as 1% of layer neurons for inference in vision transformers while
preserving 94.2% of predictive performance.
